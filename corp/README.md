## Next Basics

### File Based Routes

- Files specifically called Page.tsx placed in app folder define a route the user can visit
- The file must have a "export" default of a React component
- The name of the folder that a "page.tsx" file is in controls the route

### Layout

- `page.tsx`s inside app folder is passed to the Layout as "children"

### Folder Strategies

- `app` folder must consist of routes
- All others (components, data, utils) must be outside of `app` folder and inside `src` folder

### Adding images

- Image is built-in component in Next.js
- It optimized for loading up images
